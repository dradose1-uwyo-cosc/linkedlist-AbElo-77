## Worked with/sources 
* https://go.dev/doc/effective_go
* https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/handle-errors
## Project Quirks / Things that don't work
* In staying consistent with the function signatures provided in the assignment markdown, some methods return errors while others return Booleans to indicate the success or failure of an operation. 
* go.mod was initialized with version **go 1.25.5** on the Department Linux Machine, but **go 1.25.6** on my local VM (WSL). Had to initialize again after moving machines.
